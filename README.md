# Mutual Information Neural Estimation (MINE) [(paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04062)
Implement MINE with tensorflow

## Toy Example
Calculate mutual information between X and Y, denoted by I(X ; Y).  
X is sampled from Normal distribution, and Y is random variable denoting the result of the rolling a dice.  
In theoy, they are independent so their mutual information is zero, we will see this result in below.
