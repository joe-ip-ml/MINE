# Mutual Information Neural Estimation (MINE) [(paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04062)
Implement MINE with tensorflow

## Toy Example
Calculate mutual information between X and Y, denoted by **I(X ; Y)**.  
X is sampled from Normal distribution, and Y is random variable denoting the result of the rolling a dice.  
In theory, they are independent so **I(X ; Y) = 0**, the experimental result is shown below.
